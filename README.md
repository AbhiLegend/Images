## Evidently and monitoring production models
We have created our ml models but to get them to production is always tough <br />
As with time the model degrades.For analysing the model drift we need realtime monitoring. <br />
Evidently is such a tool/library that helps us analyse and track data and ml models for the lifecycle. <br />
## Model Scoring and model drift
For showing model scoring and model drift we need evidently library.We will work on a regression process ml model to be deployed in hroku. <br />
We will be using the UCI Bike sharing dataset <br />
## More on Model drift with respect to evidently library
Partculary we will focus on datadrift which is a type of model drift .The description is mentioned in the previous section <br />
If we elaborate evidently it works on the mentioned ways. <br />

## How to check for a drift within a production model
We will be using fastapi and the production model needs to be deployed in heroku.For proper and ease of deployment we will use github <br />

# Understanding the Evidently Data Drift Dashboard
## Data Drift Table
![alt text](https://github.com/AbhiLegend/Images/blob/main/model%20drift/df.PNG) <br />
The table generated by the html shows the drifting features <br />
Evidently is very useful for early monitoring of model quality <br />
In production to check for model decay <br />
## Deploying the model to heroku and observe Model drift(data drift)
Make sure you have a github account.First fork the repo {fast7} <br />
We will also need a free heroku account for deploying the model <br />
When we get inside heroku we will click on new app <br />
![alt text](https://github.com/AbhiLegend/Images/blob/main/model%20drift/1.PNG) <br />
We will give a new app name leave other details unchanged and click on create app <br />

It will next take you to the deploy tab make sure that github account is linked.On the deployment method click on github tab <br />

Search for the forked repo and click on search <br />
![alt text](https://github.com/AbhiLegend/Images/blob/main/model%20drift/4.PNG) <br />
When the repo is found we need to click on connect <br />

In the Automatic Deployment section make sure we enable automatic deploy <br />
![alt text](https://github.com/AbhiLegend/Images/blob/main/model%20drift/6.PNG) <br />
On the named tab option click on deploy branch <br />
![alt text](https://github.com/AbhiLegend/Images/blob/main/model%20drift/7.PNG) <br />
After all steps you will see the app is deployed.Click on view. <br />
